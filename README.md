Wafer Fault Detection Project - README
Project Overview
In the field of electronics, a wafer serves as a foundational substrate for the fabrication of integrated circuits, including those used in microelectronic devices and solar cells. The manufacturing process involves several intricate steps such as doping, ion implantation, and thin-film deposition. This project focuses on the detection of faults in wafer production through the application of machine learning.

Problem Statement
Data
The project utilizes data from wafers, which are crucial components in the production of solar cells and microcircuits.

Challenge
Wafers are often located in remote areas, and their production involves numerous sensors. The manual identification of faulty wafers is time-consuming and costly. The goal is to implement a machine learning solution that can automatically detect faulty wafers, thereby eliminating the need for manual inspection and minimizing disruptions in the production process.

Solution
Approach
The solution involves passing the data collected from wafers through a machine learning pipeline. The algorithm will analyze the data and determine whether a given wafer is faulty or not.

Benefits
Cost Reduction: Automation reduces the need for manual labor, saving both time and resources.
