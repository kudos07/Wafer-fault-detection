# Wafer Fault Detection Project

## Project Overview

In the intricate field of electronics manufacturing, wafers are foundational substrates used for the fabrication of integrated circuits, key in microelectronic devices and solar cells. The manufacturing process is complex, involving steps like doping, ion implantation, and thin-film deposition. This project aims at automating the detection of faults in wafer production through machine learning.

## Problem Statement

Wafers are essential in the production of components for solar cells and microcircuits. They are often produced in remote facilities equipped with numerous sensors. Manually spotting defective wafers is not only time-consuming but also costly. The goal of this project is to engineer a machine learning solution for the automatic detection of faults in wafers, thus obviating the need for manual inspection and reducing production stoppages.

## Solution Approach

Our solution involves running wafer data through a machine learning pipeline that analyzes and determines the fault status of each wafer.

## Benefits

- **Cost Reduction**: Automating fault detection reduces the need for manual labor, thus saving time and resources.
- **Efficiency**: Swift and accurate fault identification lessens disruptions in the manufacturing process.
- **Preventive Maintenance**: Early fault detection facilitates timely interventions, preventing downstream production issues.
